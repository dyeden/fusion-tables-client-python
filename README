OVERVIEW:

The python Fusion Tables Client library helps you connect and run queries on 
your tables in Fusion Tables.

You can select 2 methods of authentication: OAuth or Client Login.
The python-oauth2 library is used for OAuth.

Two helper classes have been included in this library to make coding
easier: CSVImporter and SQL. 

CSVImporter allows you to create a new table from an existing CSV file.

SQL builds SQL statements for you, in case you don't want to fully type out
"SELECT ..." or "INSERT ..." every time. 


DEPENDENCIES*:

- python-oauth2 library: http://github.com/simplegeo/python-oauth2
- python-oauth2 dependency, httplib2: http://code.google.com/p/httplib2/

*if you are not planning on using OAuth, you can potentially delete the
authorization/oauth.py file from the library. In this case, no dependencies
are required.


SAMPLE CODE:

#login and run select query using clientlogin
clientlogin = ClientLogin(username="username", password="password")
ftclient = FTClient(clientlogin)
results = ftclient.query(SQL().select(12345, None, "height > 10")


#login and run select query using oauth
oauth = OAuth(consumer_key="mydomain.com",
			  consumer_secret="g4i3543/453496052"
			  domain="mydomain.com")
print oauth.generateAuthorizationURL()
raw_input("Visit the URL listed above to grant access. Hit enter to continue")
oauth.authorize()
ftclient = FTClient(oauth)
results = ftclient.query(SQL().select(12345, None, "height > 10")


#import data from a CSV file
csvimporter = CSVImporter(ftclient)
csvimporter.importFile("input.csv")
